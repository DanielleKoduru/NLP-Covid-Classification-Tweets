# NLP-Covid-Classification-Tweets-Project

This code is used to generate text classification for covid tweets using Natural Language Processing.
The dataset used here is publically available data from Kaggle. You can download the data using the below link. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification

Here is the link to the original code examlpe in github. https://github.com/utkarshx27/Kaggle-Work-ML-Models/blob/6bb5faee1af9bd5ae5adb0c911adcecd6aab7de3/covid-tweet-classification-nb-vs-lstm.ipynb

The various tasks are as follows:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data pre-processing
3. Data Modeling (with Training/Test Data)
4. Classification of covid tweets (Naive Bayes algorithm vs. LSTM)
